# 3D-MIMO-SAR_Imaging

Integration of millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensors with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging will enable costeffective
and scalable solutions for a variety of applications including security, automotive, and surveillance.

In this repository, a three-dimensional (3-D) holographic MIMO-SAR imaging algorithm is implemented. Important signal processing functions
such as near-field multistatic image reconstruction suitable for large MIMO apertures, multi-channel array calibration, and multistatic-to-monostatic conversion are presented in the context
of 3-D MIMO-SAR imaging.
